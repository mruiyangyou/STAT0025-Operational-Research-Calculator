# University College London STAT0025 Opreational Research Assiatance App

This repo is an introduction to how the web calculation app works. The website requires you to know a bit about **Python**.

## STAT0025-Web-App

The web incorporates the most type of questions in the STAT0025 syllabus, ranging from **Graphic solution, Simplex algorism visualization, BigM visualization and Markov dynamic programming**. For rest of the question like dynamic programming and two-phase visualization, it is still under development. As I know, many students are unfamiliar with operational research. 

This website aims to help students understand the process of calculation and save them much time as it is 100% consistent with the syllabus and easy and concise to use. 

Most questions aim to solve maximise question if the problem is minimised. Simply type your coefficient of cost function into: **$ -1 \times $ coefficient of cost function**


* Minimize: [3, 8] = Maxmize [-3,-8]

Most input is Python list. If you don't understand the list, simply understand it as **matrix**. Make sure if you type any non-numeric character(str), remember to add "" not ''.

Everyone can access the page through: **[STAT0025-Web](https://stat0025-help-app.herokuapp.com)**



## Futher 
The whole project is still under development and I will update as soon as possible. Thank you for using and hope this helps your operational research learning!!! Feel free to contact me through **m.ruiyangyou2@gmail.com** or fork the repository.
